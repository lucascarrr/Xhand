XHAND Image Processing

Currently not ready at all 

I've used direct paths for input/output folders at the moment (makes it less tedious for me to test results).

You can just change these paths to your desired folders (the code for this is located in the main method of Driver.py)

To run the software, you are required to build the venv:

>make install

>source venv/bin/activate

>python Driver.py

Please feel free to make alterations and submit a pull request
